# 📐 PanHandler - Professional Measurements from Your Pocket

**Version:** Alpha v1.65  
**Status:** Production Ready 🚀  
**Platform:** iOS (Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.76.7)

---

## 🎯 What is PanHandler?

PanHandler transforms your iPhone into a precision measurement tool. Using coin-based calibration and advanced computer vision, it delivers professional-grade measurements for CAD work, construction, design, and engineering.

**No hardware needed.** Just a coin and your phone.

## ✨ Features

### 📐 Measurement Tools
- **Distance** - Linear measurements between two points
- **Angle** - Three-point angle measurements with azimuth bearing mode
- **Circle** - Radius, diameter, area, circumference
- **Rectangle** - Dimensions and area (length × width)
- **Freehand** - Trace irregular shapes with ultra-precise lasso mode (Pro)
  - **NEW in v1.65**: Smooth, fluid lines with 0.3mm snap precision

### 🪙 Smart Calibration
- **Coin Calibration** - Use any common coin (50+ supported)
- **Map Scale** - Measure from maps, blueprints, drawings
- **Auto-Level Capture** - Hold level to auto-capture perfectly straight photos
- **Auto-Leveled Album** - Auto-captured photos saved to dedicated album
- **Remembers** - Last coin used for quick setup
- **Accurate** - Professional-grade precision

### 🎨 Beautiful Design
- Watery glassmorphic UI
- Dynamic color-coded measurements
- Haptic feedback throughout
- Gesture-based controls
- Dark/light adaptive

### 💾 Professional Export
- **Email** - Measurements + annotated photo
- **Save to Photos** - With measurements burned in
- **CAD Export** - DXF format (Pro)
- **Labels** - Custom names for measurements

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Take a photo** of what you want to measure
2. **Select a coin** for calibration
3. **Zoom** until the coin matches the circle on screen
4. **Lock in** - you're calibrated!
5. **Tap** to place measurement points
6. **Export** via email, photos, or CAD

---

## 💰 Pricing

### Free Forever
- ✅ Unlimited measurements
- ✅ Unlimited exports  
- ✅ Coin calibration
- ✅ Distance, Angle, Circle, Rectangle tools
- ✅ Map mode

### Pro ($9.97 one-time)
- ✅ Freehand tool
- ✅ CAD export (DXF)
- ✅ Zoom calibration upgrades
- ✅ Lifetime access - no subscription

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### The Math
```
1. User zooms image to match coin to reference circle
2. App calculates: pixelsPerMM = (circleDiameter / zoomScale) / coinDiameterMM
3. For any measurement: realWorldDistance = pixelDistance / pixelsPerMM
```

### Why It's Accurate
- Coin diameter is precisely known (standardized minting)
- Zoom calibration captures exact image scale
- Sub-pixel precision cursor for placement
- Mathematical verification at every step
