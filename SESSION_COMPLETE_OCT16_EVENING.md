# Session Summary - October 16, 2025 (Evening)

## Overview
Completed recalibrate button functionality, added privacy/permissions documentation, and polished calibration UI. Fixed critical bug where measurements weren't cleared on recalibration. **NEW**: Polished bubble level with bigger crosshairs, enhanced glow, and fixed vertical mode.

---

## Features Completed

### 1. Recalibrate Button - Full Implementation ✅
**Initial Work** (from previous session summary):
- Added red "Recalibrate" button below calibration badge
- Made it go to calibration screen with same photo (instead of camera)

**Bug Fix** (this session):
- Fixed: Old measurements remained visible after recalibrating
- Now properly clears all measurements and points when recalibrating
- Clean slate for new calibration

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/DimensionOverlay.tsx` - Button UI and `onReset(true)` call
- `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx` - Handler with measurement clearing logic

---

### 2. Privacy & Security Section ✅
Added comprehensive privacy information to Help Modal:
- 📱 Photos stay on device (never uploaded)
- ✉️ Email only for sending reports (never shared)
- 👁️ Zero tracking/analytics
- ☁️ Works offline, lightweight

**Files Modified**: `src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

---

### 3. App Permissions Guide ✅
Added "App Permissions" section to Help Modal:
- Lists required permissions (Camera, Photo Library)
- Clear instructions: "Settings → PanHandler → Enable Camera & Photos"
- Short and actionable as requested

**Files Modified**: `src/components/HelpModal.tsx`

---

### 4. Calibration Screen UI Polish ✅

#### Help Button Position Fixed
- **Issue**: Button was way off-screen to the right
- **Fix**: Moved to `right: 70` (was `right: SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.15 + 8`)
- **Result**: Fully visible with proper spacing

#### Coin Selector Enhanced
- **Alternating row colors**: Light white / subtle gray pattern
- **Larger tap targets**: 18px vertical padding (up from 16px)
- **Better visual separation**: 6px margin between rows
- **Improved press states**: Dark highlight on tap
- **Better typography**: Larger, bolder text
- **Taller list**: 280px max height (was 240px)

**Files Modified**: `src/components/ZoomCalibration.tsx`

---

### 5. Bubble Level Polish ✅ **NEW**

#### Fixed Vertical Mode Y-Axis Movement
**Problem**: Bubble wouldn't go below crosshairs (negative Y values) in vertical mode.

**Root Cause**: Used `absBeta - 90` which only gives positive values.

**Fix**: Changed to `beta - 90` (signed value) for both positive and negative offsets.

**Result**: Bubble now moves up AND down in vertical mode! 🎉

#### Made Crosshairs 20% Bigger
- Container: `100px × 100px` → `120px × 120px`
- Max bubble offset: `40px` → `48px`
- All positions updated for new size

**Result**: Crosshairs are more playful and fun! 🎯

#### Enhanced Bubble Glow & Mystique
**Improvements**:
- Size: `15px` → `18px` (more presence)
- Border width: `2px` → `2.5px`
- Shadow radius: `8px` → `16px` (2x larger glow!)
- Shadow opacity: `0.9` → `1.0` (full intensity)
- Inner glow: Brighter white (95% opacity)
- **NEW**: Added outer glow ring for extra mystique ✨

**Visual Layers** (Outside → Inside):
1. Shadow glow (16px radius, mystical aura)
2. Outer ring (subtle 40% opacity aura)
3. Border (2.5px, 90% white)
4. Main bubble (vibrant color)
5. Inner glow (8px white light source)

#### Enhanced Smoke Trail
- Particle opacity: `0.4` → `0.5` (more visible)
- Shadow opacity: `0.6` → `0.8` (glowier)
- Shadow radius: `4px` → `6px`

#### Removed All Text
- ❌ Adaptive guidance text ("Hold still", "Tilt forward")
- ❌ "Center object here" text
- ❌ "(place coin in the middle)" hint

**Result**: Clean, minimalist UI with just the bubble level! 🎨

**Files Modified**: `src/screens/MeasurementScreen.tsx`

## Bug Fixes

### Recalibrate Measurements Clear Bug ✅
**Problem**: After tapping Recalibrate, old measurements remained on photo when returning to measurement screen

**Solution**: 
- Added `setCompletedMeasurements([])` to clear all measurements
- Added `setCurrentPoints([])` to clear active drawing points
- Applied to BOTH recalibrate mode and full reset mode

**Impact**: Users now get a clean slate when recalibrating, no confusion from old measurements

### Bubble Level Vertical Mode Bug ✅ **NEW**
**Problem**: Bubble couldn't move below center (negative Y) in vertical mode

**Solution**: Use signed `beta` value instead of absolute `absBeta`

**Impact**: Bubble now correctly responds to all tilt directions in vertical mode

---

## Technical Details

### Recalibrate Handler Logic
```typescript
if (recalibrateMode) {
  // Keep photo, clear everything else
  setCoinCircle(null);
  setCalibration(null);
  setMeasurementZoom({ scale: 1, ... });
  setCompletedMeasurements([]); // NEW
  setCurrentPoints([]); // NEW
  setMode('zoomCalibrate');
} else {
  // Full reset to camera
  // Clear all state including photo
}
```

### Coin List Alternating Colors
```typescript
backgroundColor: index % 2 === 0 
  ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)'  // Light (even rows)
  : 'rgba(240, 240, 245, 0.85)', // Darker (odd rows)
```

### Vertical Mode Physics (Fixed)
```typescript
// Phone held vertically (beta > 45°)
const verticalTilt = beta - 90;  // Signed! Can be negative
const bubbleYOffset = (verticalTilt / 15) * 48;
// beta = 105° → verticalTilt = +15° → bubbleY = +48px (down)
// beta = 75° → verticalTilt = -15° → bubbleY = -48px (up)
```

### Bubble Glow Layers
1. **Shadow glow**: 16px radius, full opacity (main mystique)
2. **Outer ring**: 4px outside border, 40% opacity (subtle aura)
3. **Border**: 2.5px, 90% white (defined edge)
4. **Main bubble**: Vibrant session color
5. **Inner glow**: 8px white dot, 95% opacity + shadow (light source effect)
